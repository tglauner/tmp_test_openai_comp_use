## scroll_browser.py

This script opens Google Chrome on macOS at
`https://www.tglauner.com/mastering_interest_rate_derivatives` and scrolls down
and up twice. It uses `pyautogui`, so ensure you have it installed and have given
accessibility permissions on macOS.

### Usage

```bash
pip install pyautogui
python scroll_browser.py
```
